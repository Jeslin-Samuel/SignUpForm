# SignUpForm 
This project emulates a sign up form. The form asks for attributes which include: name, email, password, and confirmation 
of the password. The sign up from has a button which acts as the "save button". If any of the above listed feilds are missing upon click of the button, a toast message is displayed asking for all information to be feild. Likewise, if the password and the password confirmation does not match then an error message is displayed say that the feilds dont match and prompts the user to try again. If the conditions are satisfied, then the user is throw a message that weclomes them to the Sign up form app.
